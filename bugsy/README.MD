# Bugsy - A small, robust little robot

> Project creation date: 14/06/2024  

The Bugsy is concepted as a robust little rover-like robot, that just uses two chains for movement, meaning no complex steering or other kind of movement is required.

## Log

Here the projects creation is documented, alongside with some of the experiences I made and their impacts on the final outcome (if there is any).

### Design choices

The initial design intended it to look a lot more like an actually tank, but as I want it to look a little cute and the chains I bought will be rather impractical in a classical tank setup, I have chosen a newer design with a higher body and a lower back.

### Planning the components to build in

Another task is to define which electrical components should be used by the bugsy to get as much information as possible, while not spamming the network and communication methods used.

### Sketching

### First chasis CAD
