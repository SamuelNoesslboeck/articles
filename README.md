A collection of journals about my projects, thoughts and more. Please excuse the typos in these journals, as I am writing these in Visual Studio Code without the use of any auto-correct or similar things, so please be so kind and just ignore them (there is gonna be a lot of them whoopsy).

May of the articles are written in a kind of diary /log / blog style, as my main idea behind this is for myself to keep track of thoughts and ideas behind some projects and as a kind of documentation I guess? Maybe you as a reader can gain something from the mistakes I made or similar.

## Overview
