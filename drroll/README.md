A mobile storage for technical drawings!

## Idea / Concept

As larger paper like A2 and above require either folding, rolling or other ways to be transported in a meaningful way and I personally dislike folding any paper for purposes other than origami (which I actually love), I took one of the cardboard rolls where you usually keep stuff like posters in and used it for my technical drawings.

## Project Log

A more detailed project log with concept art and more is available [in the documentation](documentation/project_log.md)!
