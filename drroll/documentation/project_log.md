## Project Log

First I used to tie the roll to my backpack using ropes and pieces of clothing, it became quite a meme among friends and family that you will hardly see me without my precious backpack and the roll attached to it.

But as these things are not designed for longer term use of permanent transportation they have no handles or attachments for belts and similar, I soon needed some custom attachments to the roll.
